# Osiris: A Scalable Dataset Generation Pipeline for Machine Learning in Analog Circuit Design

**Osiris** is an end-to-end analog circuits design pipeline capable of producing, validating, and evaluating layouts for generic analog circuits.

The [Osiris GitHub repository](https://github.com/hardware-fab/osiris) hosts the code that implements the randomized pipeline as well as the reinforcement learning-driven baseline methodology discussed 
in the paper proposed at the NeurIPS 2025 Datasets & Benchmarks Track.

The [Osiris ðŸ¤— HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hardware-fab/osiris) hosts the randomly generated dataset discussed in the paper.
